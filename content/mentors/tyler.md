I am a FIRST Tech Challenge alumni from the Northeast Ohio area. I am currently a junior at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland where I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s of science in computer science with minors in business management and computer engineering. I also work part-time at Rockwell Automation as an embedded software engineer.  
  
I joined FIRST Tech Challenge back in 2011 as a 7th grader. I competed in FTC throughout high school until graduating in 2017. Along the way, I was a part of the 2016 world championship winning alliance and also won the Control Award at the 2016 world championship. Now, I volunteer as a game announcer, emcee, and field/phone inspector at FTC tournaments throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania.

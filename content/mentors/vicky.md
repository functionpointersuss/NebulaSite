I am a proud FIRST alumni of the Syosset Robotics program. Throughout high school, a great majority of my time was spent in the robotics room. It was truly a pleasure to take part in FTC competitions, for it not only helped me build confidence, but also a network of people that felt like family.  
  
Currently, I am studying electrical engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology. Applying skills outside of classes, I take on the role of a Propulsion System Lead for a Formula Hybrid team. I have also interned at GE Transportation for the Traction Control and Auxiliary System team. I hope to expand my knowledge on engineering/validation processes to further assist the creation of detailed engineering notebooks. The growth of the Syosset Robotics program makes me extremely happy and I look forward to seeing all that they accomplish in the near future!

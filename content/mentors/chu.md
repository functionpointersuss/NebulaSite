Engineering and science have been a part of my life since childhood, from tinkering in my fatherâ€™s machine shop in Texas and studying mechanical engineering at MIT to my early career at Ford. Although I changed careers to practice patent law at a NY firm, Amazon, and now with Athorus, PLLC, I still enjoy digging into the engineering details of inventions.  
  
In my spare time, I enjoy playing games with my two kids, chauffeuring them to ballet, taekwondo, and sports lessons, and watching all things NFL, especially my hometown team, the Cowboys.  
  
Although I do not have prior experience with FIRST, I have also always had a love for robotics. Having the opportunity to mentor the FIRST Syosset Nebula team and seeing their growth and development has been very rewarding. I hope to have the opportunity to continue as a FIRST mentor for many years.

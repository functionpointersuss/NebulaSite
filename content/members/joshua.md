### General description of yourself, what you like to do, and a fun fact about you
I am a person who is willing to have laughs and joke. (e.g. Dan Godbeck) I like to pass De Rosa quizzes as a hobby, but it is very difficult. Also, I enjoy playing minecraft, seeing that Tejas is playing CS GO on discord, and reading interesting academic papers. One fun fact about me is that I can speak 3 different languages i.e. Spanish, English, Korean (2/3 only enough to get by, not 100% native fluent).

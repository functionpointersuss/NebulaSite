### General description of yourself, what you like to do, and a fun fact about you
I “love” to swim, but it’s a love hate relationship more like. I also love to eat food, I love listening to music and collecting seashells on the beach. I love watching anime (Boku no Hero Academia and Seven Deadly Sins season 4 just came out!) My favorite anime of all time is “I want to eat your pancreas.”
